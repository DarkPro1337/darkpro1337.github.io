I just moved them up, as it was in the Russian version of Arcomage for PC. Here is a little example of it in-game:\nOf the current plans, I would like to note that I want to rewrite the AI ‚Äã‚Äãfor the bot. It works very strangely, and sometimes hangs up the game. I would like to get rid of this, and teach him how to use cards with forced discards. I need to finish the animation of the appearance of the card in the deck, I still haven\u0026rsquo;t figured out how to do it correctly.

It\u0026rsquo;s Art–µm again, I\u0026rsquo;m alive, I\u0026rsquo;m still working on the remake of Arcomage, I\u0026rsquo;ve been very busy the last few months because of my studies. But I tried to find time to make some progress. So I would like to write a small change log of current updates.\n1. The game will have its own website! #Yes, the game already has its own pages on itch.io and GameJolt, but I thought it would be nice if the remake had its own website. It looks something like this.\nThe main idea is a page where you can download the latest version of the game with one button.\n2. HTML5 version! #Yes, the game can be played in the browser. I hope this feature will live to release, but it seems like the tab with the game eats no more RAM than YouTube tab.\nIf everything goes well, the HTML5 version of the game will be the same as the usual one, but if something goes wrong, I will make a separate version of the game for the browser.\n3. Card graveyard #This is the place where the cards will be placed after use, a fairly simple feature that was in the original game, but I killed a lot of time on it.\n4. Particles! #As in the original game, cards have their own positive and negative effects for players, for clarity, which are displayed in the form of particles scattering from objects of attention, they are now in my remake.\n5. Force card discarding action #In the original game, there were a number of cards that had a forced discard action, this function has not yet been implemented in the remake, BUT now it is.\n6. Localizations! #The original game had different language versions as different distributions of the game. This is not the most convenient way to support language packs (locales). Now you can easily translate the game into your native language. You just need to contact me and ask for access to the online spreadsheet.\n\u0026hellip;and this isn\u0026rsquo;t end! #The main functionality of the game (in single player mode) is almost ready! The first offline version of the game will be out soon. The next major update will be online multiplayer.\nUnfortunately, at the moment I am very busy with my studies, and I cannot devote most of my time to development, please be patient!\n","date":"27.05.2021","permalink":"/projects/2021/arcomage-remake-updates-first-release-soon/","section":"Projects","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;m still working on the remake of Arcomage, I\u0026rsquo;ve been very busy the last few months because of my studies.

I am an indie developer working on a remake of the Might \u0026amp; Magic series card mini-game called Arcomage.\nI really love Arcomage and want to make a really good remake. I try very hard to keep its original appearance. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to add any other balance-breaking functionality. Perhaps later I will add a direct ability to create my own decks, something like mods, both based on a standard deck of cards, and completely your own. At the moment I am working on repeating the version that was in Might and Magic itself, i.e. version for one player, and a computer as an opponent. Later I will be working on multiplayer modes. Since I develop all this alone, I do not have a release date for specific versions.\nWhat has already been done so far:\nFully updated graphics (using upscale via Topaz Gigapixel AI and waifu2x). Now all the graphics look just fine, and just like in the original. Moved the entire original card deck to the database for ease of localization. The whole interface is also easy to localize. Basic mechanics. Using cards and their scripts. The original sounds have been carried over to the remake. I am thinking about improving their quality, but I don‚Äôt know how to do it yet. Original interface. Everything looks exactly the same as in the original. And then there are the cool particles! Some kind of AI for the opponent (computer). I already really want to rewrite it from scratch, but all the hands do not reach. You can find a list of all the planned features or features that I\u0026rsquo;m working on now, well, just the progress of the project, on my Trello board.\nThank you all very much for your interest in the project.\nThanks to Alexander Krop for initiation to the wonderful world of Might and Magic and Arcomage in particular. Thanks a lot to him for the inspiration to make this remake.\nThanks to the cool guys from the r/MightAndMagic subreddit, they very warmly accepted my post about the fact that I am developing a remake.\n","date":"05.10.2020","permalink":"/projects/2020/arcomage-remake-i-m-working-currently/","section":"Projects","summary":"Hello!
