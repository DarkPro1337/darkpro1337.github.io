The issue was that I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to allow direct DLL injection—highly insecure and prone to abuse by injecting malicious code that could compromise user systems or steal sensitive data like passwords.\nInstead, I opted for a sandboxed approach where mods execute safely without posing risks to end users. My goal was to create a common API for all mods to make them both safer and easier to write. That\u0026rsquo;s when I came across a video by the nameless dev that clearly and concisely explained how to implement WASM mod support. Huge thanks to the author for sharing his insights!\nI was aware of WebAssembly before, but I hadn’t considered it as a sandbox for running script-based mods in a game. It was a revelation to learn that Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020 uses WebAssembly for mod scripts—and that\u0026rsquo;s pretty awesome!\nSo, I decided to try something similar for Arcomage. In this article, I\u0026rsquo;ll share my findings and ideas on implementing WASM modding in Godot .NET.\nWhat Is WebAssembly and How Do You Use It? #WASM is a bytecode format that runs in a virtual machine. Unlike .NET\u0026rsquo;s CIL, WASM is designed to execute in browsers or any application that supports it. In our case, we\u0026rsquo;re using Godot\u0026rsquo;s .NET version. For .NET, several embedded WASM runtimes exist. In my project, I used Wasmtime from the Bytecode Alliance.\nExample: Creating a WASM Mod #Setup #First, add the Wasmtime NuGet package to your Godot .NET project:\ndotnet add package wasmtime Alternatively, add the following Package Reference to your .csproj file:\n\u0026lt;PackageReference Include=\u0026#34;Wasmtime\u0026#34; Version=\u0026#34;22.0.0\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; Don\u0026rsquo;t forget to run dotnet restore after modifying your project file.\nTo compile WASM files from AssemblyScript, install Node.js (which comes with npm). You can download it from Node.js\u0026rsquo;s official website. Verify the installations with:\nnode -v npm -v In this example, we\u0026rsquo;ll compile WASM using AssemblyScript. If you prefer another language (like Rust with wasm-pack), refer to its documentation. I also highly recommend reviewing the AssemblyScript compiler docs.\nAfter installing Node.js, run:\nnpm install -g assemblyscript This installs the AssemblyScript compiler globally (or install it locally if preferred).\nWith the necessary tools in place, it\u0026rsquo;s time to write some code!\nWASM #Choose a working directory and create two files: env.ts and mod.ts.\nIn env.ts, define the exported functions you want available to your WASM mod:\n@external(\u0026#34;env\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;host_log\u0026#34;) declare function host_log(ptr: i32, len: i32): void; export function log(message: string): void { const encoded = String.UTF8.encode(message); host_log(changetype\u0026lt;i32\u0026gt;(encoded), encoded.byteLength); } In this example, the log function sends a message to the host via host_log, which receives a pointer to the UTF-8–encoded string and its length.\nIn mod.ts, write the code to execute in the WASM mod:\nimport { log } from \u0026#34;./env\u0026#34;; export function init(): void { log(\u0026#34;Hello, World!\u0026#34;); } Here, the exported init function will be called upon mod initialization, triggering a log message. On the Godot side, you\u0026rsquo;ll handle this (for example, by printing it to the console with GD.Print).\nThis simple setup illustrates the concept. As a developer, share the env.ts file with your modders so they can use the defined functions. In this scheme, mod.ts serves as the mod\u0026rsquo;s entry point, where you specify an entry function (in this case, init) that the game calls automatically when loading the WASM file.\nTo compile your WASM mod, run:\nasc .\\mod.ts -o mod.wasm If AssemblyScript isn’t installed globally, ensure you provide the correct path. Running this command produces a mod.wasm file—the entry point for your mod.\nGodot .NET Integration #Place the compiled WASM file in your Godot project\u0026rsquo;s user directory (e.g., user://mod.wasm).\nI recommend using a custom user directory, enabled via the application/config/use_custom_user_dir flag in your project.godot file. Also, set a folder name using application/config/custom_user_dir_name.\nCreate a new C# class inheriting from Node—in my example, it\u0026rsquo;s named WasmLoader:\nusing Godot; using System.Text; using Wasmtime; using Engine = Wasmtime.Engine; public partial class WasmLoader : Node { public override void _Ready() { byte[] wasmBytes; using (var file = FileAccess.Open(\u0026#34;user://mod.wasm\u0026#34;, FileAccess.ModeFlags.Read)) wasmBytes = file.GetBuffer((int)file.GetLength()); using var engine = new Engine(); using var module = Module.FromBytes(engine, \u0026#34;mod\u0026#34;, wasmBytes); using var store = new Store(engine); using var linker = new Linker(engine); linker.Define(\u0026#34;env\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;host_log\u0026#34;, Function.FromCallback(store, (Caller caller, int ptr, int len) =\u0026gt; { var memory = caller.GetMemory(\u0026#34;memory\u0026#34;); if (memory is null) return; var span = memory.GetSpan\u0026lt;byte\u0026gt;(0); var message = Encoding.UTF8.GetString(span.Slice(ptr, len).ToArray()); GD.Print(message); })); linker.Define(\u0026#34;env\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;abort\u0026#34;, Function.FromCallback(store, (int msg, int file, int line, int column) =\u0026gt; { GD.Print($\u0026#34;Abort called at {file}:{line}:{column}\u0026#34;); })); var instance = linker.Instantiate(store, module); instance.GetAction(\u0026#34;init\u0026#34;)?.Invoke(); } } Let\u0026rsquo;s break down what happens in this code:\nThe WASM file is loaded from user://mod.wasm and its bytes are passed to Module.FromBytes. An Engine, Module, Store, and Linker are created to execute the WASM mod. The functions exported by the mod are defined. Here, host_log takes a pointer and length, decodes the string from memory, and prints it. The abort function is also defined; it’s called on errors within the WASM mod. Although you might not need it, the compiler includes it by default. Without defining it, you’d get a Wasmtime.WasmtimeException for an undefined import. Finally, the WASM mod is instantiated and its init function is invoked, printing \u0026ldquo;Hello, World!\u0026rdquo; to the console. After creating the WasmLoader class, add it to your scene and run the game. If everything is set up correctly, you should see \u0026ldquo;Hello, World!\u0026rdquo; in the console. Alternatively, you can add the loader to your project\u0026rsquo;s Autoload to run it at startup.\nNext Steps #Here are a few ideas to expand your modding system:\nForwarding Process Callbacks:\nPass the _Process and _PhysicsProcess callbacks to the WASM mod (remember to include delta as a parameter) so it can interact with the game each frame—for example, updating object positions:\npublic override void _Process(double delta) { foreach (var mod in _mods.Values) mod.Instance.GetFunction(\u0026#34;process\u0026#34;)?.Invoke(delta); } Here, _mods is a Dictionary storing loaded mods, with the mod name as the key and a record (containing the mod instance and its path) as the value. You can similarly forward events (like an exit event) when the game closes or a mod is unloaded.\nCreating a Mod API:\nDevelop a Mod API that exposes functions (e.g., log, spawn, destroy, move) for modders. Aim for simplicity and clarity, and document the API thoroughly so modders know what’s available and how to use it.\nAutomatic Mod Loading:\nImplement functionality to load WASM mods from a designated folder, allowing modders to simply drop their mod files into the folder for automatic loading. Also, consider adding support for unloading mods to avoid performance issues with too many active mods. A full mod management interface (such as one integrated into the game menu) would be a great enhancement.\nI hope this small article helps you implement WASM modding in your Godot .NET games.

I try very hard to keep its original appearance. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to add any other balance-breaking functionality. Perhaps later I will add a direct ability to create my own decks, something like mods, both based on a standard deck of cards, and completely your own.

Since I develop all this alone, I do not have a release date for specific versions.\nWhat has already been done so far:\nFully updated graphics (using upscale via Topaz Gigapixel AI and waifu2x). Now all the graphics look just fine, and just like in the original. Moved the entire original card deck to the database for ease of localization. The whole interface is also easy to localize. Basic mechanics. Using cards and their scripts. The original sounds have been carried over to the remake. I am thinking about improving their quality, but I don’t know how to do it yet. Original interface. Everything looks exactly the same as in the original. And then there are the cool particles! Some kind of AI for the opponent (computer).
